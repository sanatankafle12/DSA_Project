This project was created as a part of the Data Structure and Algorithm course as Computer Engineering. <be><br>
It contains knights tour which is a famous problem. In this Problem, we are supposed to move the knight to all squares without repeating and leaving squares unvisited. It is implemented using Backtrackking as well as a Hereustic known as Warnsdorff's Rule which implies that knight must travel to a square that has least possible spaces to travel to.<br><br>
We have also implemented a minimum steps From knight where, User is supposed to find the best moves for knight to move from a given square to another<br><br>
Requirements:<br><br>
-> python<br>
-> pygame<br>
